function Find-ESC7 {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        This script finds Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) Certificate Authorities (CA) that have the ESC7 vulnerability.

    .DESCRIPTION
        The script takes an array of AD CS objects as input and filters them based on objects that have the objectClass
        'pKIEnrollmentService'. If the CA objects have non-standard/unsafe principals as administrators or managers, an issue is created.

    .PARAMETER ADCSObjects
        Specifies the array of AD CS objects to be processed. This parameter is mandatory.

    .PARAMETER UnsafeUsers
        Principals that should never be granted control of a CA.

    .PARAMETER SafeUsers
        Principals that are generally recognized as safe to control a CA.

    .PARAMETER SkipRisk
        Switch used when processing second-order risks.

    .OUTPUTS
        The script outputs an array of custom objects representing the matching AD CS objects and their associated information.
